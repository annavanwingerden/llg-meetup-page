This is a simple Next.js app that displays a meetup page for the London Longboard Girls meetup.

Libraries used: 
- Shadcn UI (components)
- Lucide (icons)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)

Frameworks used:
- Next.js 

Languages used:
- TypeScript

APIs:
- OpenMeteo to get the weather forecast
- SheetsDB to get message updates from organisers

This is an MVP that I am running by the co-organisers for feedback. 
You can access this [here](https://llg-meetup-page.vercel.app/).


Future improvements: 
* Ask for high-res London Longboard Girls logo and branding assets
* Change into a predictive skating conditions app by adding a prediction of whether the ground will be dry based on past rain, sun + wind conditions
